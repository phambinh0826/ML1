=====================

Network analysis formalizes the study of relationships, and social network
analysis pertains to relationships among individuals, groups, or other social
entities. While an assortment of social network approaches exists, greater

We then cover in more detail how network analysis formalizes the
conceptualization, data collection, and visualization of relational data.
