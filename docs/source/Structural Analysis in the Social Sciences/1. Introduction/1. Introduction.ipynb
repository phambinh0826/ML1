    "Harrison White, a scholar with PhDs in physics and sociology. Academics\n",

    "growth of a transdisciplinary perspective of network analysis. The earliest\n",
    "period (from the 1930s to the 1950s) was denoted by mostly theoretical and\n",
    "qualitative research exploring basic concepts and relating them to social theory.\n",
    "The second period (from the 1960s to the 1980s) saw the emergence of a set of\n",
    "metrics and methods further elaborating network properties and their variation.\n",
    "Most recently (since the 1990s), a period of massive increases in scale and\n",
    "computing power has enabled network comparisons and hypothesis testing\n",
    "about network formation to a degree not previously possible. Each age has\n",
    "brought shifts in the type of scholar leading the charge – from theorist, to\n",
    "exploratory social scientist, to hypothesis-testing physical scientists and engineers\n",
    "– and a disconnect across what was learned in one era after the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this text, we propose to integrate these views and to center the development\n",
    "of network concepts and methods around core questions of network\n",
    "structure and its formation. The key, we believe, is to tightly couple the\n",
    "methodological treatment with substantive questions that a researcher may\n",
    "hope to answer empirically. Such an approach is particularly important given\n",
    "the increasing availability of network data. Social networks and network\n",
    "thinking are more ubiquitous than ever because of the use of networking\n",
    "platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Social networks\n",
    "are present in the endless number of forums, conversational threads, and\n",
    "streams of comments found on websites, online courses, and listservs.\n",
    "Companies, too, are awash with digital records and transactional data represented\n",
    "in streaming relational databases that they are not sure how to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, today research is experiencing a new empirical watershed of digitized\n",
    "communications, which has hastened the emergence of methodological\n",
    "transactionalism – that is, the capacity to empirically capture and theoretically\n",
    "explain interactions, which are frequently the traces of relations, observed at\n",
    "various levels from face-to-face encounters to global flows of goods (Kitts &\n",
    "Quintane 2020; McFarland, Diehl, & Rawlings 2011). For much of the mid- to\n",
    "late twentieth century, the individual was a practical, reified source of information\n",
    "collected through surveys. Today, that information comes from digitized\n",
    "social transactions, and the streaming of relational information has made\n",
    "the individual merely a point buffeted along within rivers of transactional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is not to love for a social researcher? The trouble with much of the\n",
    "contemporary research on networks is that novices learn a singlemethod, acquire a\n",
    "network data set (e.g., Twitter), and then without reflection apply themethod to the\n",
    "data. This approach, like using a hammer so ubiquitously that everything comes to\n",
    "look like a nail, can often lead to poorly executed or inappropriate analyses given\n",
    "the data and research questions. Most methods appeal to a particular question or\n",
    "class of questions and therefore do not apply to every problem. In addition, the\n",
    "problem that a method was meant to address can often have little relevance to the\n",
    "focal phenomenon in question. For example, in studying who retweets whom, a\n",
    "researcher may pick up a few network ideas of social influence that were based on\n",
    "how individuals in small groups experience conformity pressures, using these to\n",
    "“make sense” of thousands of tweets among total strangers for whom the original\n",
    "network conformity pressures have almost no chance of actually operating. Thus,\n",
    "there is often a gap between technical capabilities andmore conceptual understandings.\n",
    "And many treatments of current methods in network analysis have only\n",
    "widened this gap by presenting methods with little conceptual context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, this volume offers an integrative approach to network analysis\n",
    "that will be useful for filling the gap between methodological sophistication and\n",
    "theoretical and empirical purpose. For those scholars lacking technical capabilities,\n",
    "this volume can fill the technical gap concerning how to do structural\n",
    "analysis while helping to build and develop their theoretical agendas. For those\n",
